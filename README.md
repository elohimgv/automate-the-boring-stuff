# Automate The Boring Stuff With Python

I like to apply the technique that I learned in _Learn Python the Hard Way_ **instruction**. Obviously this book is not designed to work through this approach, but I manage to do it. I read,  reflect,  analyze, copy the code the same that in the book, then come back and I see how to do the same in other form. And finally I solve the proposed exercises. This is more or less how I use the book, always flexible, experimenting with it.
